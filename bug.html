This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a utility class that doesn't exist.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 @apply text-red-600">
</div>
```

If the class `text-red-600` is not defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration, this will cause a build error or unexpected behavior.  The error message may vary depending on your build setup, but it usually indicates an unknown or invalid class.
