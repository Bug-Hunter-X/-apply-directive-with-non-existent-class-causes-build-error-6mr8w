The solution is to add the missing class to your Tailwind configuration or remove the reference in the `@apply` directive.  Here's the corrected HTML:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500">
</div>
```

Or, if you intend to use `text-red-600`, ensure it's included in your `tailwind.config.js` file's `content` array (or defined appropriately within your CSS if you're not using the JIT mode).

Example of adding it to your content array (JIT mode):

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html}",
  ], 
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

If you are not using JIT mode then you need to add the class definition to your main css file.
